summary: Why Hugo? Why not VuePress / Hexo?
---

I’ve tried both Hexo and VuePress, and they are both good static site generators. However, they both rely on Node.js, which is annoying. I have to worry about dependencies.

Using Hugo is much simpler. Just install it and everything works well with no dependencies. Also, you don't need admin permission to install it.

Above all, I don’t need powerful or beautiful features for my blog. All I want is a simple design.
